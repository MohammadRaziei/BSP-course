There is a submodule for the 5th question, that is OSET toolbox for matlab written by Dr. sameni. here is main address : https://gitlab.com/rsameni/OSET.git
but because of using gitlab instead of github, I prefer to fork it from main refrence and then add it as submodule. so following link is for it!
